# Get Started with DITA

Two examples are included in this repository. The output files are in separate directories.

Part #1: Piano Tuning Example
On 3/17/2019 as of about 1:10pm:
- These files were first updated by oXygen, validated, and used to create HTML and PDF output.
- The HTML and PDF output files were then zipped up on my local computer.
- These files were then copied and pasted manually back into GitHub into my get_started_dita repository,
	  in the lekBranch.
- I'm expecting NO FURTHER CHANGES at this point, as this was an example introductory DITA project, and my
    oXygen free trial will expire soon. I plan to create a new project with different content
    for the next part of the assignment involving oXygen.
    
Part #2: Mounting and Matting Art
- Started 3/18/2019 @8:30am. Copied these files to my local computer. Then I edited them in oXygen to turn into content about Mounting and Matting Art.
- Later I copied the files back to GitHub after completing in oXygen.

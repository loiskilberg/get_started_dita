  <title>Tuning a Piano</title>
  <shortdesc>You can tune a piano with just a few pieces of equipment.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>You'll need to listen to overtones and understand octaves and chords.</p>
    <p> We live in an imperfect world. If you tune to match perfect overtones,
         the octaves will be out of sync.
         There are various schemes for tuning.
         We'll show you how to tune to a perfect fifth, then lower it very slightly so
         that it matches all the way up and down the keyboard.
         Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier" showcases how the keyboard
         can sound when tuned to sound good in every key.</p>
    <p>At its simplest, you can tune a piano using only:
       <ul>
            <li>your ear</li>
            <li>a tuning hammer</li>
            <li>four dampening wedges
       </ul></p>
